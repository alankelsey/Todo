# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Amplify

- `npm install -g @aws-ampilify/cli`
- Create IAM user to get access key
- `amplify configure`
  - needs region
  - needs IAM username
  - needs IAM user access key and secret access key
  - default profile name
- `amplify init`
- `amplify hosting add`
- `amplify publish` to deploy live after making changes

### User auth

- `ampilify add auth`
- `amplify status`
- `amplifly push`
- `npm add aws-amplify aws-amplify-react`
- `cat aws/aws-exports.js`
- look at aws cognito to verify that identity pool was created

### GraphQL API with Dynamo DB

- `amplify add api`
  - choose rest or (pick graph)
  - name: todo (defaults)
  - authType: Amazon cognito user pool
  - annotated schema: no
  - guided schema creation: yes
  - description type of schema: single object
  - do not have a schema
  - create a schema
- `amplify push` (updates exports.js also)
- generate code force: yes (defaults for the rest)
- defaults for the rest
- Get client ID from cognito user pools to run queries from aws app sync
- ``
